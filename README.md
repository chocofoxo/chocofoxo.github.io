# Data Science Projects
Below are examples of recent projects I completed as part of my Master of Information and Data Science project at the UC Berkeley School of Information. 
Please note: I have included links to all of the code that I am able to share. For team projects, I am only sharing the code I fully owned, although I also contributed to building and debugging the code of my teammates. I am unable to share code for homework assignment that are still being used in the courses. 
## Predicting Flight Delays

**Timeline:** Oct-Dec 2024  
**Course:** Machine Learning at Scale (DATASCI 261, School of Information, UC Berkeley)  
### Problem
Given raw data from commercial airlines, airports, and weather stations from 2015-2019, build a pipeline that predicts whether a flight will be delayed or not 2 hours before its scheduled departure time.
### Tools Used
* Azure Databricks with MLFlow
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python, Spark
* Optuna
### Pipeline

### Key Tasks
* Project plan to define objectives and metrics, budget time and resources, and avoid data leakage
* Strategy to checkpoint along the pipeline to save work and optimize limited resources
* EDA of raw data to generate summary statistics, note trends, and provide guidance for feature selection, encoding, and engineering
* Clean pipeline to process the data in preparation for classification models
* 

### Deliverable
The deliverable for this project was a final report detailing the exploratory data analysis (EDA), experimentation, approach, results, and conclusions, along with linking to supporting Jupyter notebooks. I am unable to post the report but happy to share more details on a call. This was completed as a team of five.
